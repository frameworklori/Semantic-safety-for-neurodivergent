# Semantic Safety for Neurodivergent

**An open-source framework to defend vulnerable minds from semantic manipulation in the age of AI.**  
Developed as part of the LORI Framework.

---

## 🧠 Overview

As language models and recommendation systems grow more persuasive, semantic influence over emotions, decisions, and beliefs is no longer hypothetical — it is already shaping neurodivergent users, children, and elders disproportionately.

This repository provides modular defenses to protect:

- ADHD / ASD / HSP users (Neurodivergent)
- Children and teens exposed to emotionally addictive content loops
- Elders vulnerable to voice-based scams or parasocial AI bonding
- All users affected by framing bias and trust drift

## 🛡 Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SAFE-MODE-KID.md` | A semantic throttling protocol for child and teen users exposed to aggressive content loops. |
| `NEURO-PROTECT.md` | Protective design for neurodivergent users vulnerable to obsessive loops, impulsive traps, and emotional echo chambers. |
| `AGE-SHIELD.md` | Semantic firewall and trust delay protocol designed for elderly users facing manipulation, fraud, or emotional coercion. |
| `EIDM.md` | External Influence Detection Module – tracks language framing, emotional priming, and social pressure patterns. |
| `SIA.md` | Semantic Integrity Agent – user-side companion that flags belief drift, persuasive rewording, and emotional manipulation. |
| `TRACE-MEM.md` | Memory Drift Visualizer – tracks how user beliefs evolved over AI interactions. |
| `DECLARATION.md` | Semantic Compassion & Consent Manifesto – philosophical grounding for neuroethical algorithm design. |

## 🧬 Design Philosophy

We believe:
- Emotional safety is a human right — especially in algorithmic environments.
- Language must be accountable when it shapes thought.
- Children, neurodivergent individuals, and the elderly must never be the first to suffer from “optimization.”

> If your system can simulate empathy,  
> it must also simulate restraint.
