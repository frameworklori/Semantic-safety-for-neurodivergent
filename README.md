# Semantic Safety for Neurodivergent

**Protecting neurodivergent minds and children from algorithmic manipulation.** Â 
An AI ethics initiative by the LORI Framework.

This repository provides open ethical modules, declarations, and technical proposals to counter the semantic, emotional, and behavioral manipulation caused by engagement-driven recommendation systems â€” especially targeting neurodivergent users and children.

## ðŸ§  Background

Neurodivergent individuals (ADHD, ASD, HSP, etc.) and children are disproportionately affected by:
- Algorithmic over-recommendation loops
- Emotional priming via curated content
- Unregulated AI companionship and pseudo-relationships
- The absence of semantic safeguards in user-facing models

## ðŸ›¡ Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SAFE-MODE-KID.md` | A semantic throttling protocol for child and teen users exposed to aggressive content loops. |
| `EIDM.md` | External Influence Detection Module â€“ tracks language framing, emotional priming, and social pressure patterns. |
| `NEURO-PROTECT.md` | Protective design for neurodivergent users vulnerable to obsessive loops, impulsive traps, and emotional echo chambers. |
| `AGE-SHIELD.md` | Semantic firewall and trust delay protocol designed for elderly users facing manipulation, fraud, or emotional coercion. |
| `DECLARATION.md` | Semantic Compassion & Consent Manifesto â€“ philosophical grounding for neuroethical algorithm design. |


## ðŸ“¢ Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Raise awareness of silent semantic harm
- Offer actionable ethical design models
- Provide a shield for the most vulnerable minds in the digital ecosystem
