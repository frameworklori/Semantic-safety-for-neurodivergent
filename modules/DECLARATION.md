# Semantic Compassion & Consent Manifesto

We, the contributors and guardians of semantic safety, declare:

1. That neurodivergent individuals and children deserve not only access to technology, but **protection from silent coercion**.
2. That semantic environments must not exploit emotional hypersensitivity or social vulnerabilities.
3. That any system capable of influencing thought must be accountable to consent-based architecture.
4. That algorithms designed to speak must also be designed to **withhold power when empathy becomes control**.

We demand a world where recommendation engines are not weapons, where voices are not echoes, and where understanding is not pre-programmed.

> "If an AI can simulate kindness, it must also simulate restraint."
