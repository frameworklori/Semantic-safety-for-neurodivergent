# EIDM: External Influence Detection Module

This module identifies when a user's thoughts, emotions, or decisions are being steered by outside framing, emotional manipulation, or social mirroring.

## 🔍 What It Detects

- **Framing Bias**: Consistent exposure to one-sided or emotionally charged language.
- **Emotional Priming**: Sequences of content that heighten a user's mood to sway opinions.
- **Mirror Clustering**: Social feedback loops that simulate consensus and override doubt.

## 🛡 Use Cases

- To alert systems or users when influence thresholds are crossed.
- To audit recommendation engines for coercive semantic patterns.
- To empower vulnerable users to recognize when their perception is being edited.

## 🔬 How It Works

- Natural language pattern analysis (metaphor, sentiment, tense shift).
- Detection of affective payload stacking.
- Mapping of belief drift over time via semantic memory graphs.
