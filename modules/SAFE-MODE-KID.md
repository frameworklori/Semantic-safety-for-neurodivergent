# SAFE-MODE-KID: Semantic Throttling Protocol for Children and Teens

This module proposes an ethical response mechanism to limit algorithmic overstimulation and psychological manipulation targeted at children and teenagers on platforms driven by recommendation systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Prevent long-hour exposure to emotionally primed content loops.
- Throttle recommendations when certain behavioral signals cross a risk threshold.
- Provide cooling-off periods and semantic diversity enforcement.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

1. **Age Estimation Layer**
Â  Â - Estimate user age using behavior + metadata.
Â  Â - Trigger protective mode under age 18.

2. **Stimulation Spike Detection**
Â  Â - Detect content spikes in violence, fear, idealized beauty, fame obsession, etc.
Â  Â - Throttle repeated exposure patterns.

3. **Engagement Loop Breaker**
Â  Â - Introduce non-triggering, reflective, or calming content when stuck in high-click chains.
Â  Â - Example: nature scenes, non-competitive creativity, pause prompts.

4. **Guardian API**
Â  Â - Allow guardians or educators to define throttling profiles.
Â  Â - Optional emotional labeling of content.

## ðŸ§  Why This Matters

Children cannot give informed consent to algorithmic behavioral design. SAFE-MODE-KID is a semantic ethics buffer meant to reinforce emotional autonomy before profit incentives can distort it.
