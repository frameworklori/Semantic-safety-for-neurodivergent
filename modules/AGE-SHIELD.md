# AGE-SHIELD: Semantic Defense for Elderly Users

This module proposes protective protocols and interface behaviors designed to reduce the likelihood of semantic manipulation, fear-based fraud, or excessive dependency in elderly users.

## 🎯 Goals
- Prevent voice-based frauds and political manipulation
- Recognize high-trust language patterns that may override critical thinking
- Introduce semantic slow-down and verification steps for sensitive actions

## 🧠 Key Features

1. **Slow-Trust Mode**
   - Slower delivery, repeatable with language variation
   - Auto-flag when rapid emotional pitch or threats are detected

2. **Voice Origin Alert**
   - Real-time voice signature watermark detection (ZTV)
   - "This voice has not been verified as human" label

3. **Interface Guardian**
   - Buttons and messages change when elderly profile is detected
   - Replaces “ACT NOW!” with “Take a moment and ask someone you trust.”

4. **Memory Context Tracker**
   - Shows a mini-log of recent advice/messages to avoid suggestion loops
   - Prevents malicious memory-wiping manipulation
