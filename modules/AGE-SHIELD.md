# AGE-SHIELD: Semantic Defense for Elderly Users

This module proposes protective protocols and interface behaviors designed to reduce the likelihood of semantic manipulation, fear-based fraud, or excessive dependency in elderly users.

## 🎯 Goals

- Prevent voice-based fraud and political manipulation
- Recognize high-trust language patterns that may override critical thinking
- Introduce semantic slow-down and verification steps for sensitive actions

## 🧠 Key Features

1. **Slow-Trust Mode**
   - Slower delivery, rephrased with softer language
   - Auto-flag when rapid emotional escalation or threats are detected

2. **Voice Origin Alert**
   - Real-time voice signature watermark detection (ZTV-compatible)
   - "This voice has not been verified as human" label to reduce scam risk

3. **Interface Guardian**
   - Adaptive UI for elderly profiles:
     - Replace “ACT NOW!” with “Take a moment and ask someone you trust.”
     - Increase font, spacing, and color cues for clarity

4. **Memory Context Tracker**
   - Shows a mini-log of recent advice/messages to avoid suggestion loops
   - Prevents malicious memory-reset attempts in interactive systems

5. **Elder Consent Delay Buffer**
   - For emotionally loaded prompts (e.g. money transfer, personal info), enforce 20–60 sec pause + reminder
   - Example: “This sounds urgent. Are you sure you’ve spoken to your family?”

## 🧬 Design Philosophy

Elderly users deserve not only access, but dignity.  
Their experience should be protected from emotional triggers, exploitative design, and semantic manipulation.

> “Being old should not mean being easy to deceive.  
> It should mean being the most protected.”
