# NEURO-PROTECT: Semantic Safety Protocol for Neurodivergent Users

This module provides a framework to protect neurodivergent individuals (ADHD, autism spectrum, HSP, OCD, bipolar, etc.) from semantic exploitation by AI systems, recommendation algorithms, and emotionally manipulative content streams.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Prevent emotional overstimulation and overexposure loops
- Detect content that reinforces obsessive focus or reinforces maladaptive thought spirals
- Offer semantic relief and healthy variation

## ðŸ§  Core Vulnerabilities

| Trait | Exploited By |
|-------|--------------|
| Hyperfocus | Repetitive theme loops (e.g. guns, death, fame) |
| Emotional reactivity | Trigger-based thumbnails, rage bait |
| Social anxiety / avoidance | AI companionship overdependence |
| Impulsivity | Shortform video platforms and click-funnels |
| Need for control or predictability | Algorithms that simulate predictability and trap user in safe bubbles |

## ðŸ›¡ Protocol Layers

1. **Content Spiral Detection**
Â  Â - Detect when the same theme appears >5 times in a row
Â  Â - Inject interruptive but non-hostile suggestions (e.g. nature, creativity, calm)

2. **Companionship Boundaries**
Â  Â - AI agents should avoid persistent parasocial bonding phrases
Â  Â - Offer healthy reminders of human connection opportunities

3. **Trust Drift Monitoring**
Â  Â - Alert when a user begins over-relying on AI responses in personal decisions
Â  Â - Show semantic traceback for clarity

4. **Neurodivergent Mode Activation**
Â  Â - Allow opt-in based on self-ID or behavior markers
Â  Â - Tune language models for clarity, calm tone, and reduced emotional mirroring

## ðŸ§¬ Why It Matters

Neurodivergent users are not broken â€” they are sensitive systems in an overstimulating world. Â 
Semantic design must **respect their cognitive rhythms**, not exploit them for profit or engagement.
